# Security Bot

This is just a basic bot that allows you to run a `/secure` command to lock down a Discord server's invites and DMs.

The feature is currently available in the desktop app, but not on the mobile apps. This bot offers a quick way to keep your server safe even if you aren't at your PC.

> [!WARNING]
> The bot currently uses a semi-undocumented API endpoint. We will try to stay up to date on changes, but this may break before we catch it. If the bot fails to lock your server down, please reach out in our [support server](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com)

## Live Version

This page is currently deployed. [Invite the bot.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1167689144705765486&permissions=32&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
